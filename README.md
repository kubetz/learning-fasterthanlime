This is a repository where I store projects based on the great work from [fasterthanli.me](https://fasterthanli.me/).

The goal is to learn Rust from the man himself and document "my path towards enlightement" here ðŸ¤“. I made this repo public in case someone else finds the code here useful.

Available projects:
- [futures](futures) - [Understanding Rust futures by going way too deep](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep)
